# Project Euler done in Golang

If you're coming from google looking for an answer for your Euler's problem,
be sure you've tried long enough before ! Best way to learn is to get stuck.

Then, understand the code before copying.

Oh, and btw i don't use the Bignum module in Golang, because i feel it's not really
fun and make some problems to easy.
